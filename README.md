=================

<img src="images/animal_farm_full.jpg" style="width:300px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" alt="Animal farm"/>

Animal Farm is a series of labs intended to teach the basics of C and C++.  It's also intended to introduce good
Software Engineering practices.  Students are expected to "Live" in
this project as the code evolves over a series of requirements.

| End of Semester     | We never finished the following requirements due to the end of the semester.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Animal Farm 4       | A collection class that implements a doubly linked list.  <br/>Add Fish, Bird and Dog to the object model.<br/>Build a class factory for Cat.  <br/>Add destructors to the object model. <br/>Create a CatLinkedList that inherits from SinglyLinkedList… and then implement findCatByName <br/>Have Cat override > to sort cats by name<br/>…think about how we are going to sort our animals |
| Animal Farm 5       | Refactor the collection class into a Binary Search Tree.  <br/>Add Birds and Fish to the object model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
